        <h2>Developer Tools</h2>
        <p>
          The current build includes developer tools that you may accidentally interact with on the keyboard:
          <ul>
            <li>[E] will toggle the level editor on/off. The level editor allows free movement which can be useful if you encounter a bug and get stuck in a wall or if you just like to explore out of bounds or skip puzzles. Be warned that turning on the level editor may hurt the immersion of the game for you.</li>
            <li>[R] will reset the current area as if you left and returned to it. Mostly useful if you want to restart a puzzle.</li>
            <li>[SHIFT]+[R] will clear most progress flags for the current dungeon which will respawn all enemies, bosses, close opened chests and doors, and reset switches and other puzzle elements.</li>
            <li>[CTRL]+[K] will defeat all enemies including bosses in the current super tile.</li>
            <li>Opening the context menu (right click, or control click on macs) will open a menu that allows you to either teleport to certain locations, or test certain states in the game. These options will overwrite your current save file, so please use them carefully</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
