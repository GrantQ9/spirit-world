Procedural Generation Notes:

Game Constraints:
    Final item pool
        Required items
        Optional upgrades: life, weapons
    Enemy pool
        Enemy generation/randomization:
            modify life, damage, weaknesses/immunities, elemental damage, speed, aggression, behavior difficulty
    Boss pool
        Similar parameterization to enemies
    Dungeon constraints:
        # of dungeons
        # by size/type/relative difficulty
        Order constraints (free for all vs linear vs dungeon groups)
            This could be represented by a graph with edges that include multiple source nodes.
    Overworld 
        Size
        segmentation



Specific Dungeon Constraints:
    Worlds - array of Material/Spirit
    Styles - Stone Temple, Natural Cave, Cave Temple, Stone Tower, Wood Temple etc, including hybrid like "Wood Tower inside Stone Temple"
    Size: 0-N number of additional rooms beyond the minimum required to satisfy all constraints
        Additional size will be filled with:
            key rooms (possibly with obstacles/enemies/puzzles)
            travel rooms (empty or with obstacles/enemies/puzzles)
            dead ends (possibly traps or trash loot)
    Boss+Enemy Pool (subset of the pool for the entire game)
    Obstacle Pool - Arrow traps, pits, etc
    Dungeon prizes - Array of items that can be found in the dungeon
    Boss prizes - Array of items that can be found upon completing the dungeon
    Additional Required Items - Array of dungeon prizes that must be used to complete the dungeon.
        - If this includes items that are not required for entrances or provided by the dungeon it may be difficult for players to determine whether or not
        they meet the requirements for completing a dungeon.
        - As long as this is a subset of dungeon prizes, then players can complete dungeons so long as they can get beyond the entrance and are skilled enough to overcome enemies/traps/bosses with their current loadout.

    Shortcut items - Array of aditional items that unlock shortcuts in the dungeon
    optional items - Array of additional items that may be required for optional prizes.
                     If these are specified than some prizes in the dungeon may not be obtainable even when the dungeon itself is completable
                     and may require backtracking later to obtain.
    Entrance specifications - List of entrances and associated required item sets
        Exterior Required Item Sets - Array of item sets, at least one of which the player will have on entering the dungeon
            - For example [[Cat Eyes, Bow,], [Cat Eyes, Gloves]] for Tomb
              or [[roll, lightningBlessing], [roll, Mitts], [roll, lightningMagic], [roll, invisibility]] for Sky Palace
        Interior Required Item Sets - Array of item sets that the dungeon will require in order to access the rest of the dungeon from this entrance.
            The cross product of exterior X interior items sets for a door form the set of required external item sets for completing the dungeon.
        Geographical information:
            style: ladder up/down, stairs up/down, N/E/S/W door or path
            floor
            relative location (eg North, Middle, Southwest)
    Exit specifications - List of exits and associated requirements
        In addition to required item sets, these can also specify:
        Whether they require completing the dungeon
        Whether they can be blocked by optional items
        Geographical information:
            style: ladder up/down, stairs up/down, N/E/S/W door or path, teleporter
            floor
            relative location (eg North, Middle, Southwest)

Combat difficulty:


Desirable Dungeon Traits and How to Produce them
    * A memorable, visually impressive hub that the player will traverse multiple times
        - Gives the player a landmark to orient themselves around allowing a more complex dungeon without making it too difficult to navigate
        - Having a hub structure keeps the dungeon "bushier" and reduces the longest path between parts of the dungeon
        - Examples:
            Eastern chest room 7 exits, 3 minimum visits
            Desert entrance ~4 exits, 1 minimum visit
            Hera entrance 4 exits, 3 minimum visits
            PoD arena 6 exits ? minimum visits
            Swamp chest room 6 exits 2 minimum visits
    * Key and locks that require backtracking
        - Prevents the dungeon from being too linear
        - Locks present subgoals which help break the large dungeon mission into more manageable pieces
        - Don't have to be literal keys and locks, can be switches, unique items+obstacles
        - Doesn't have to be 1-1. A "key" might open many "locks" or a "lock" might require multiple "keys" to open.
    * Key item that re-contextualizes the dungeon
        - Opens access to new parts of the dungeon (usually a one key to many locks situation)
        - Makes dungeon more convenient
            - Grants access to shortcuts making it easy to navigate previously time consuming routes
            - Applies in dungeon combat in a meaningful way
    * Good bosses+mini bosses
    * A unique theme/gimmick that distinguishes the dungeon from others
        * The "Fire" dungeon or "arrow trap" dungeon or "rolling ball puzzle" dungeon
        * At least one unique enemy type/category, or strongly represented enemy type: "undead", "bugs", "water monsters"
        * These things need to be contextually determined at the world level to prevent duplication.
            * A dungeon that requires multiple visits to complete like the Tower of Babel in Mystic Quest is fun and memorable, but would not
              be as good if there were two or more similar dungeons in the same game.
            * Similarly, there should be enough gimmicks that not every gimmick is present in every world, and some gimmicks should preclude others
    * Strong cohesion
        * Factors listed above are cohesive, so theme matches gimmick, enemies, bosses and key item
        * Everything seems to belong together. It is easy to remember which aspects belong to which dungeon.
    * Optional rewards
        * Makes work/reward feel better in larger dungeons if there are prizes to be found amongst challenges and dead ends.
        * Rewards player for exploring and fully engaging with the dungeon.
            * Don't want the player to feel like they are wasting time in a dungeon by not finishing it ASAP.
    * Easy backtracking
        * Backtracking is desirable as mentioned above, but it can also be annoying if it is too difficult/time consuming/boring
        * Don't require players to complete the same challenges multiple times (boring+time consuming, perhaps difficult in an uninteresting way)
        * Design challenges so that they are quick to back track through after finishing
            * Leave enemies defeated in gauntlet rooms
            * Add two-way shortcuts that open up on completing mazes
            * Add one-way doors to force players to take shortcuts when backtracking so they don't accidentally take long paths back
    * No deep locks
        * A deep lock is a lock that is more than one room/challenge away from the path to the key once the lock is discovered
            * Requires the player to backtrack significantly if they find the lock before the key
        * The lock can be several rooms off of the path to the key so long as a quick shortcut is created back to the key path.

Gradual Approach
    -Create generators at many tiers, narrow to broad, for example:
        Chunk generator - generates content to fill a rectangle of space, for example, a small puzzle for hitting a single switch, an obstacle or enemy that can be used in many context.
            Chunks can be used during room generation or as pieces of otherwise static rooms.
        Room generator - generates a room that fills an entire section satisfying given constraints including entrances/exits
        Dungeon generator - generates a dungeon satisfying given constraints
        World generator - generates an overworld satisfying given constraints
    - Each of these generator types could be used by itself with enough content.
        - For example a dungeon generator could be created using hand crafted rooms similar to Rogue Legacy/Spelunky style generation
        - Chunks can be included in hand crafted areas
        - World generator could be used and link to hand crafted dungeons
            - This can probably be broken up into smaller generated areas similar to rooms/chunks in dungeons.
        - In general generated content can live in/next to/around crafted content
    - Ideally any good hand crafted content can be changed into a generator
        - A hand crafted puzzle can be parameterized into a style of puzzle with variable size/difficulty/requirements
            - Highly flexible puzzle chunks can satisfy a wider variety of constraints and allow more higher level possibilities.
            - Flexible enough puzzles can be reused during generation when their constraints are different enough to make it not feel repetitive.
        - A hand crafted room can be changed to use multiple chunks internally and entrance/exit configurations to satisfy various room generation requirements
        - Various aspects of hand crafted dungeons can be coded into dungeon generator styles and dungeon generator constraints
        - There should be some ways of gradually taking hand crafted world designs and porting them into generators for the overworld.
