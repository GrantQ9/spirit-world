Add ability to assign active tools to the X/Y buttons.
    -Display a colored box around the items that correspond to the color of the button on the controller as well as a letter.
    -Track most recent input to control keyboard vs controller type

Add meditate ability
    - stand still and hold the passive tool button to grow a ring of spirit sight around you
    - release and press passive tool button to stop
    - if astral projection is available, you can move around (need to press passive tool on body to return or press somethiing else to return instantly?)
    - if telekinesis you can pick up real objects (possibly limited by telekinesis level)

Add example prologue area:
    - Add text boxes
        - Space/shift/enter to advance/dismiss
        - On start
        - On pickup item
    - Floor switches to open exit from area that gives roll technique
    - NPC that gives weapon?
    - Peach of Immortality at the end

Add connected areas + dungeons

Add animation for breaking stone hitting the ground.

Animate hearts refilling

Fix leaving an area section and immediately returning doesn't reset objects
    - Fix tiles should also be reset when leaving an area section?

Allow player to choose difficulty during the opening by completing tasks:
    - Solve more difficult puzzle to set puzzles to difficult
    - Complete more difficult enemy encounters to set combat to difficult
    ?? Complete opening without picking up a weapon to set to weaponless mode ??
    - Maybe add an option to manually change the difficulty later just in case.

Include some random dungeon design in the base game:
    - Location of key under object might change (there should be some clue where it is or use spirit sight).
    - Something like peg cave, but only a single peg needs to be pressed to open it (spirit sight reveals which?).
    - Something like Easter Palace Foyer except the correct door isn't always the center door.

Keep in mind significance of design elements for future racing/randomizer.
