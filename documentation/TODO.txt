Test at http://localhost:81/alttp/public/

Known Bugs:
    - Door closing sound plays while in the title screen
        - Maybe just disable playAreaSound in the title scene or only play this sound if the player passes through the door and it closes behind them.
    - Teleporting while grabbing a pot with astral projection can make you face south but still be grabbing the pot
        - Probably stop grabbing with projection when teleporting.
    - Player is rendered behind ceiling when climbing ladders
        - Possible solution: render player on foreground layer when climbing ladders.
    - Enemies hit in the spirit world make noise when taking damage
        - this might be nice to keep for the cocoon boss
        - when players can actively hit enemies in the spirit world we should play a sound. For example, hitting an enemy with a linked bush shouldn't be silent.
    - Clone tool bugs
        - Mana regen is wrong when using clone tools (seems to multiply consumption/regen by number of clones)
        - Should destroy clones when the clone technique is unequipped.
        - Clones should all share the same tools (store tools on state instead of hero)
    - Held rocks/bushes are invisible while using cloak
    - Piercing projectiles that can push things should be stopped by the first object they push
        or not be able to push additional objects, for example, the charged chakram.
    - Astral Projection appears in front of waterfall graphics only when south of main body in waterfall tower.
    - Pushing on a solid object sitting on thorny ground shouldn't hurt you:
        -return tileBehaviors and objectBehaviors separately, only damage if tile is solid+damaging.
    - nextAreaInstance is not rendered in Safari
    - Enemies with small hitboxes are checking pixels outside of their hitbox while moving.
        - For example snakes when moving left/right will be forced to move up if there is a wall to their south.
    - Can get to undefined area in city by sinking in the water.
    - Cliff Edge issues:
        - Would be nice if staff could go across edges.
        - Bow/chakram can fire up thin cliffs
        - Bow/chakram cannot fire down southern cliffs.
    - Projectiles can fire in between black abyss tiles, for example, shooting a bow at an east or west wall it may go through instead of stopping.
    - Shadow renders behind door tops when jumping down ledges.

Graphics:
    Add slam effects for the staff.
    Sweat animation when pulling on something you cannot move.
    Add Item Get Frame gfx/wukongimportantitem.png 20x28
    Add sparkles to peach loot + hud.
    Add damage effects for hitting enemies?
    Add damage effect for player hurt? (alttp doesn't have anything like this)

Current tasks:
    - Smith should say upgrade Chakram instead of weapon

    - Use red snake for flame snake.

    - Clone Explosion doesn't work on Crystal Collector

    - Staff should always hit the full 4 tiles for now.

    - Staff should either not cover the ball goals, or prevent them from being used when covered

    - Improve unconnected teleporter graphics to show other world instead of just random light

    - Add 'only' visibility option to layers that hides everything else when selected.

    - Pit inside mountain river should empty into the top waterfall in a seris of inside waterfalls in the waterfall cave
        - Redesign waterfall cave to include more vertical elements, including terraces waterfalls that drain to the entrance

    - Fix bead flow depth by using sprite ordering for the ordered part instead of foreground, use the y value based on where it hits the floor but only draw it start 16px up from that point so it gradually covers while moving behind it.

    - Test all scripted events work
        - NPC dialogs
        - Rival right outcomes
        - Elevator

    - Add full buildings to Summoner ruins in Spirit World.
        - Populate with War God Alcolytes and the Progenitor Spirit

    - Add some additional requirement for completing crater to put the boss out of logic with few items.
        - Switches that can only be hit with staff or clone throw + iron boots

    - Add `getLogicalZone` function that returns a logical zone for a given state location wich can differ from the actual zone key, use this for randomizer locations and dungeon item associations.
        - Move underwater areas into the same logical zone so that keys can be shared above and below water
        - Split different caves into distinct logical zones like 'bushCave', 'fertilityTemple', and 'ascentCave'
        - These logical zones should be added to randomizer logic nodes when they don't match the zone for the node.
        - This will also allow using the same tile in material vs spirit world in distinct dungeons, for example, tiles could be shared inside the Grand Temple and Jade Palace but be treated as distinct dungones wrt keys and checks.
        - We could probably then use this for simplifying logic to determine what music to play.
        - Should probably also use this for Nimbus Cloud entrance behavior in some cases.
        - Make sure to update Hint location names to be more specific by using the logical zones instead.

    - Fix ledges so that:
        - Right now ledges block attacks anywhere in the tile rather than just when they are on the ledge, additionally only true values apply instead of both true+false values.
        - solidMap behavior can block projectiles.
        - Shooting an arrow down N ledges allows it to go up N ledges
            - For now, have a property increments for every frame it is over a ledge in the correct direction.
            - If the property is positive, instead of hitting ledges/southernwalls in the wrong direction, decrement the property.
            - veryTall tiles will still block the projectile even when the property is set.

    - Add and test many more ledges

    - test staff interactions with ledges.

    - Prevent grabbing tiles/objects across ledges
        - on grab, check if the player can move into the object by running the movement algorithm with a special mode that ignores all normal collisions and prevents crossing ledges in any direction. Prevent the grab if this movement check fails.

    - Perhaps southern facing tiles should block left/right movement if not currently over SF tile.

    - Cloud jumping near the edges can sometimes result in landing poorly either taking damage or underground in a ledge. Would be nice to find a way to clean up jumping from ledge to ledge.

    - Allow destroying light stones when landing with iron boots?

    - Drain all lava in the crater when the fire beast isn't spawned yet?

    - Allow walking on clouds/cracked ground while invisible?
        - Would have to be careful in sky not to run out of spirit energy
        - Might be difficult to tell if checks are in logic based on mana bar
            - Could add special logic check against specific max spirit amounts to simplify this.

    - Mine cart mechanic with switchable tracks.
        - Or maybe a pipe puzzle with lava flow in the forge. Maybe NPC asks for help fixing the pipes.

    - Dungeon with super tile that is just the vertical face of a cliff/tower/tree that you can climb up/jump down to change floors.

    - Add some speaker name so it is clear who is talking in cut scenes with multiple characters.
        - Add this to cut scene with Elder+Rival

    - Update logic to account for clone throw over obstacles?
        - Wait on this until we have adjusted any obstacles we don't want to allow this for.

    - Cocoon boss
        - Make astral projection spawn from the boss small, grow, then approach the player to attack
        before becoming small again and returning to the boss.

    True sight
        For now try just rendering all spirit world objects at 50% opacity.
        Probably allow toggling it off in the menu, possibly a quick command like B_MEDITATE + B_ROLL

    Puzzle ideas
        - Send a clone into the spirit world for "temporary" true sight. Might be annoying to switch between.
        - Some kind of hazards in the spirit world that move slowly and knock you back, where you need true sight to navigate successfully because spirit sight is too slow.
        - Use a clone to stand on a switch to hold a door open.
        - Use a clone to jump off a cliff to press one switch, then destroy it and make another clone to jump down another cliff to press another switch to open a door at the top of the cliff.

    Change prep animation for explosion
        charge particles form randomly in a circle around the hero shooting into them,
        with shorter radius and more density as time passes.

    Gold Armor Upgrade
        If Spirit Chakram is fully upgraded and the player has golden mail they can use:
        500 Jade + 2 gold and 5 silver to double effectiveness of golden mail

    Editor Improvements
        - Track which zones have been changes since the last time they were exported
            - Show indicator that zone has "unexported" changes.
        - Save changes to zones to local storage and prompt to apply them when starting the editor.
        - Support undo/redo actions
            - Include in context menu when editor is active
        - Add graphical palettes
            - (low priority) super tile layout selection

    - Add SFX when the MC is damaged

    - Add sleeping Vanara to the Cocoon.
        - Can use a special NPC that doesn't face you when talking for now.
        - Use a variety of colors.

    World Tree
        Tower is a series of 2x2 super tiles with a vine for climbing to the next section that
        Floor 1 is land level + underwater(in material world)
            - Fight frost beast and destroy heart before advancing.
        Floor 2 is sky level + has unlockable exit to sky (in material world only)
            - Fight storm beast and destroy heart before advancing.
        Floor 3 is atmosphere level + is hot
            - Fight flame beast and destroy heart before advancing.
        Floor 4 is lower orbit + material zones have low gravity
            - Fight all elemental beasts together without hearts
        Floor 5 has final boss
        - Giant tree grows just to the north of the war temple and into the sky, occupying unused spaces in the SE corner of the map.
        - Climb giant vines in the tree to reach the top
        - Lower level parts may have parts where you go out and branches so you can see how high up you are getting
        - Tree is a clone of the helix, but allowed to grow to completion this time.

    World Tree Boss Void Beast
        Must rescue Champion and work together to defeat the boss
            - Mechanics where one of you creates an opening for the other to damage the boss.
            - Mechanics where you protect each other from boss attacks.
            - Failure to protect champion will:
                - Require completing a rescue mechanic or waiting long enough for her to free herself
                - Cannot benefit from champion mechanics for damage or protection while champion is out of comission
        Phases where specific elements are required to damage it.
        Phases designed for each tool, but does not require them
            - Tools can give extra opportunities to damage the boss
                - Barrier to reflect projectiles/protect champion while they attack.
                    - Maybe a mechanic where you put up a barrier and reflect attacks while she prepares a strong attack against the boss
                - Bow to shoot distant weak spots
            - Tools can make it easier to avoid attacks

    Lab + World Tree Notes:
        - Requires all elements to complete
        - Fight rival near the start to claim the last element
        - Possible flow:
            Enter throne room of the War Temple in the Spirit World and fight rival, get last element and open tunnel entrance.
                - This step is only completable after fighting the rival during the 3rd spirit beast battle.
            Tunnel takes you to the lab where the War God's Scientists have been creating Hybrdid creatures and have made a modified World Tree Seed from the Helix.
            Can(must?) find clone upgrade to complete the lab.
            The seed is activated(possibly by combined proximity of champion+MC) and grows a giant tree that MC must climb to rescue the Champion and stop the War God.
            The War God will use the engine to make a breeding ground for his drone soldiers, the MC might use it to synthesize the Vanara and Native life to coexist.

    - Flying enemies should not move over abyss tiles(make abyss tiles + ceiling tiles impassable to flying enemies).

    Peach Cave improvements
        - Add new graphics to 2F
        - Fix spirit world tiles
            - Add 4 easy checks to top floor and bombable pit entrance to basement
            - Require Mitts for entering from the bottom floor.
            - Add harder beetle boss with a Peach piece on it
            - Add 3 checks behind different tool combinations
                - cracked ground for cloud boots/ice magic
                - staff or teleportation to get across pits
                - bow+torches or fire element to unfreeze a chest

    - Add behavior that prevents non-flying enemies from crossing tiles/objects, use for cracked ground, escalators, bead cascades, etc.
        - Anything that doesn't handle enemies gracefully either needs to keep enemies out or add handling.

    Storm Beast
        - Storm Beast can turn into lightning and teleport as a beam sending shockwaves out at both ends.
        - Storm Beast can charge south to exit the battle field

    - Game occasionally plays small bits of music while muted.

    Make mutation transition use the same area instance so contents don't reset
        - Will need to add special handling to remove extra ice tiles from frost beast+heat sink battles.

    - Add new hold+walk chakram animations
        - play last 2 frames of attack animation on release.

    - Work on new waterfall graphics
        - Email Jon about waterfall graphic updates.

True sight Idea:
    - Split the screen vertically and render the current world in the left half and the alternate world in the right half (or always material left + spirit right).
    - Could be used for puzzles that involve killing enemies you can't see in the current world or puzzle elements that are too hard to figure out with spirit sight.

Combat Ideas:
    - Concentric damaging rings that collapse into the player. Player must time it so that they are close enough together to dodge roll through in order to avoid damage.
    - Rolling enemy that leaves a trail of ice/fire behind it and bounces off walls. Hitting it knocks it in different directions.

Minigame Ideas:
    - Add Vanara VR dream world with mini games.
        - Boss practice
    - Could add something like an AR arcade to spirit city


Staff Improvements:
    - Charging staff 2 should show a preview of where it will hit and get wider in addition to longer
        - This should start at 4x1, 5x1 then 6x2->10x2, 11x3->15x3, 16x4->20x4
        - Preview will only show the max size that will fit in the current space
        - Ideally you could move around while charging and the preview will update appropriately
        - Would be nice to have this preview behavior when holding down the staff button for staff 1.
    - If the staff doesn't have enough area, maybe it should still swing and hit, but despawn or bounce off the terrain after landing.

Throwing an object into a pit should use the pit animation rather than breaking.

Respawn improvements:
    Only adjust respawn when in the same screen area as the spawn point.
    Or possibly only adjust respawn when using specific doors.
        Map dungeon entrances to respawn points?

Tutorial Improvements:
    - chest instructions are lost if you exit without obtaining the chakram.
    - no instructions for picking up objects before obtaining the glove
    Add advanced combat/tool tutorials
        - Maybe NPCs in home cave, or some kind of training/tutorial dojo?
        - Hitting enemies with chakram held in hand
        - Default Charged chakram attack
        - Enemy iframes prevent them from damaging you
        - Maybe different sections for different tools.
        - Reflecting projectiles

Add more screen shakes:
    - Lava draining transition
    - Probably for some impactful boss attacks.
    - Maybe when falling from a large height.
    - Scene where elemental beasts escape and attack the holy city
        - Maybe could be periodic large shake+explosion as if there is a large explosion nearby
        - Could have different combination of effects to signify attacks from each type of elemental beast
        - Could make sure these effects are also used when actually fighting the beasts for consistency

Improve Staff Tower Setup:
    - Maybe should create a staff tower object and use this instead of the current layer solution
    - Then we can detect if you are facing the object and not standing inside it to deploy the tower.
    - Would force the tower to look consistent and make it easy to update when we have better graphics
    - Can also detect zone overworld vs sky to create the upper+lower parts correctly.
    - Can render consistent ground graphics for when the tower is not present.
    - Animation should be throwing staff into the sky as it grows with its shadow, then falls to the ground when the shadow is as large as the foundation.

High level list of things left to do:
    New dungeons(need enemies, mechanics, bosses, entrances):
        Jade Palace
        Sky Palace
        Forge
    Areas missing significant content:
        Grand Temple
        Forest Temple
        River Temple
    Missing Bosses for existing areas:
        Crater midboss
        Rival fight before Helix
        Helix Boss
            - Instead of fighting this boss, you will see it, but then abort because of the beasts attacking the city
            - Then you will actually fight this boss at the end of the Grand Temple or Jade Palace or possibly as a mid boss on the Warship.
    Missing mechanics:
        Difficulty shrines for dungeons/bosses
            - Probably just roll this into VR minigame where you can fight old bosses.
        Hero helping during first elemental beast fight
            Hero wears monk fighting attire
            Creates a spirit barrier during rage phase that MC can hide in to prevent all damage
            Attacks or distracts the beats while fighting the heart
            Adds dialog cues for guiding the MC to destroy the heart
            Heals MC or restores MC spirit energy periodically
        Rival during last elemental beast fight
        Spirit Gates + Spirit Keys
        Spirit shop + Jade Idols
        Treasure Hunter Shop
        Fertility shrine donations
    Items missing implementation:
        Charge level 2
            Bow charge 2 shoots 5 arrows in 120 degree arc -60, -30, 0, 30, 60
        Clone charge 1 + 2
        True Sight (Render certain enemies/objects flagged for true sight)
        Gloves charge 1 + 2

        - 1000 coin wallet for 200 coins
    - The first time you find money in a chest that would exceed wallet size you find a coupon from the treasure hunter for the value of the chest advertising his store.
    - Future chests that would exceed your wallet size contain treasures that you can sell to the treasure hunter for the value of the coins from the chest.
    - Every 5 chests containing money unlock new items in the treasure hunter store

    - Trade Jade Idols for items
        2 -> Peach Piece
        3 -> Spirit Key
        5 -> Quick Charge (40% reduction in time to charge)

Charge Chakram Attack:
    - Maybe change level 1 charge to spin around hero in a circle twice? Brief 0.5s invulnerability with attack animation.
    - Charge level 2 could have 2 chakrams spin at different radiuses and directions? 50 mana, lasts 4 seconds.
Chakram Improvements:
    - Add some damage or charge time bonus for timing your next attack within X frames of catching the Chakram?

At some point I should write tests to validate certain things like:
    - All zone+object targets are defined.
    - All bombable + locked doors have ids, all objects with saveStatus set have ids.
    - All objectFlags correspond to some object or dialogue key or loot type
    - All escaped dialogue corresponds to a special frame or loot type.

Clone improvements
    Add particle effects when using the clone tool (+animation eventually)

Additional Clone Tool Behavior:
    Charging the clone 1 level adds elements to the clones weapon/tools/explosion.
    Charging the clone 1 level without elements makes it invulnerable for 4 seconds.

Additional Bow Behavior:
    Arrows should have stuck frames for diagonals or stick out orthoganal to whatever they hit.
    Charge level 2 creates an elemental explosion
        - Neutral element can destroy objects similar to clone explosion.

Peach Cave Improvements:
    - Add enemies:
        - Eggs that hatch into enemies if not destroyed first
    - Sticky Web Ground
    - Add boss:
        - Spawns eggs

        - Could drop some down for certian fist slam attacks
        - Could have the boss slam against the walls when strafing side to side or raise entire body and slam ground to drop stones.
        - Could also drop additional permanent barries that reduce the safe zones on the sides.

Dungeon 2 Improvements:
    - Add more uses of spirit sight:
        - See actual elemental beasts in the front room where the statues are located.
        - Some kind of optional spirit sight puzzle for a peach piece.

    - Floating ice spike obstacles that hurt you when floating into them and prevent passing through.
        - Allow swimming over stones and then use these to prevent swimming movement where it makes sense.
    - Maybe torches should stay lit during the boss fight once turned on.
    - Add special behavior for frozen doors instead of having two door objects.


Staff Tower Improvements
    - Add content to 4F Material world, probably some sort of gauntlet that is easier when the boss is defeated.
        - Should have a short cut so it can by bypassed after completing once.
    - All machine enemies have an offline state where they cannot be damaged, and possibly can be pushed around.
        - Hitting offline machines with lightning will turn them on.
    - Conveyer belts/escalators.
        - Conveyer belts should also effect movable object/enemies on the ground touching them.
        - Ice magic can freeze the conveyer belts which stops them but makes them slippery.
        - Lightning magic will turn a conveyer belt on if it is off.
    - Disabled conveyer belt with pots on it that needs to be turned on to move the pots out of the way.


Crater Improvements
    - Add animation for draining lava
        - Add a layer for each frame of the animation, but only on the screen lava can be drained on
        - Run a script that switches to each frame with a fairly quick fade transition.
    - Add platforms floating on lava.
    - Add peg switches that require hitting with the staff to activate, replace all regular switches with these.
    - Add Flame Guardian enemies
        - Stationary like Crystal Guardian
        - Replace ents with Flame Guardians

        - Bites into the material world when the prey is near
        - Kill by evading the maw attack and then hitting it while it is briefly in material world
            - Or fight it in the spirit world if you are there
    - Add heat sink enemies
        - Like ghosts in material world
        - Become solid+vulnerable when they try to pump heat from the material world
        - Can turn lava tiles solid briefly, or solid tiles to ice
        - Will try to chase and freeze the player if they get near
            - Will lose interest in the player while frozen
        - 1 or 2 second cool down on freezing anything
    - Add Engorge Heat Sink mini boss
        - Giant heat sink that is cooling one of the under lava caves you uncover
        - 4x as large and slow, but shrinks and speeds up as damaged
        - About 2x faster than normal heats sinks at minimum size
        - On defeat it possesses the player giving them the "Cooling Spirit" ability (Fire Blessing).
        - The cave becomes hot again after the boss is defeated but they player is now immune to the effect.

War Lab
    - Praying Mantis-like bug soldiers
        - Can emerge from tubes when security beams are triggered in certain rooms.
        - Defensive stance with crossed arms that blocks most attacks
        - Leap strike attack in any direction
        - Possible dodge + Leap strike instead of blocking attack (like electric squirrel dodge)
        - Spinning Scythe projectile attack

Multi-area Boss ideas:
    - Plant-like boss that is growing in several chambers that you have to move between to defeat.
    - Boss that escapes and must be chased to different chambers.

Add Small Loot to editor that creates LootDrop
    - locked to tile grid
    - if on destructable tile (cuttable, pickup), not rendered/updated until the tile is destroyed.
        - This should actually be done for any loot, this will make it easy to hide keys under objects.
        - We can support progress items under tiles, but probably shouldn't actually use this in practice in order to avoid players searching under every tile. On the other hand, if we clearly telegraph when this happens, maybe we can void this problem and encourage players to use smart ways to check for things (like spirit sight to search under many objects for a key).
    - Default save status to dungeon
    - Add an editor option to clear the history of picked up small loots.


Add ability to charge carried objects
    Hold the passive button when picking up an object to charge
    Charge level is limited both by level of gloves/bracers and charge level.
    Should add selected element to thrown object
    Apply element changes to tiles while you hold them (bush might burn up into ash in your hands with fire element, or turn to ice)


Improve Tool Selection:
    - Color around the selection + HUD indicator should match the color of the controller button (blue + yellow for X-Box)
    - Display a letter attached to the selection based on the button/keyboard key.

Additional Staff Behavior:
    - The sides of the staff should function as a wall rather than open ground.
    Charging the staff does a very large spin attack that knocks enemies away.
        Lvl 2 charge is a screen wide attack the applies damage+element to all enemies.
    Top N pixels of character should be drawn on foreground as well so that it appears in front of staff when facing north.
        - Probably should disable staff when character is standing on any tiles marked with low ceiling just in case.

Some puzzle ideas:
    - A puzzle where 4 switches need to be hit in 200ms, you can blow up the clone in the middle to activate all at once.
    - If we place a block on top of a switch that toggles on release, we can make a door that requires you to push the block off of the switch.

Animate hearts refilling

Add spirit element that replaces the default 'none' element when the upgrade is found. In vanilla this would require getting all other elements first.

Idea:
    Objects you can bounce off of when jumping
        - Just make them solid and knock the player back a bit if the player's y velocity is >= some value?

Include some random dungeon design in the base game:
    - Location of key under object might change (there should be some clue where it is or use spirit sight).
    - Something like peg cave, but only a single peg needs to be pressed to open it (spirit sight reveals which?).
    - Something like Eastern Palace Foyer except the correct door isn't always the center door.

Support 64x64 super tiles for world map. Or maybe just 48x48.

Possible tool: Leather gloves protect you from thorn bushes.
Possible tool: Leather boots let you walk on thorny ground without taking damage.

Dungeon flavor philosophy:
    All Vanara structures are part of the Vanara ship and related to some functionality, such as the regeneration pods.
    All Native structures are built to native spirit gods who functioned as servants to the old native spirit beings and were created for specific purposes like resource harvesting, processing and crafting.
