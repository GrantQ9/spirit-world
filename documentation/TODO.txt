Test at http://localhost:81/alttp/public/

Known Bugs:
    - Door closing sound plays while in the title screen
        - Maybe just disable playAreaSound in the title scene or only play this sound if the player passes through the door and it closes behind them.
    - Teleporting while grabbing a pot with astral projection can make you face south but still be grabbing the pot
        - Probably stop grabbing with projection when teleporting.
    - Player is rendered behind ceiling when climbing ladders
        - Possible solution: render player on foreground layer when climbing ladders.
    - Enemies hit in the spirit world make noise when taking damage
        - this might be nice to keep for the cocoon boss
        - when players can actively hit enemies in the spirit world we should play a sound. For example, hitting an enemy with a linked bush shouldn't be silent.
    - Clone tool bugs
        - Mana regen is wrong when using clone tools (seems to multiply consumption/regen by number of clones)
        - Should destroy clones when the clone technique is unequipped.
        - Clones should all share the same tools (store tools on state instead of hero)
        - Unable to charge weapon while clones are active, multiple clones don't attack at the same time
        - Staff won't be placed when controlling multiple clones (one places, another retrieves?)
            - Should probably just have the primary clone place the staff
        - Bow renders on clone when another clone uses the bow.
    - Held rocks/bushes are invisible while using cloak
    - Piercing projectiles that can push things should be stopped by the first object they push
        or not be able to push additional objects, for example, the charged chakram.
    - Enemies can walk on stairs cases and over bead flows
        - Add an invisible enemy wall object?
    - Astral Projection appears in front of waterfall graphics only when south of main body in waterfall tower.
    - Pushing on a solid object sitting on thorny ground shouldn't hurt you:
        -return tileBehaviors and objectBehaviors separately, only damage if tile is solid+damaging.
    - nextAreaInstance is not rendered in Safari
    - Enemies with small hitboxes are checking pixels outside of their hitbox while moving.
        - For example snakes when moving left/right will be forced to move up if there is a wall to their south.
    - Some water instead of ice west of the lake in the spirit world.
    - Can get to undefined area in city by sinking in the water.
    - Cliff Edge issues:
        - Would be nice if staff could go across edges.
        - Bow can fire up thin cliffs
        - Bow cannot fire down southern cliffs.
    - Projectiles can fire in between black abyss tiles, for example, shooting a bow at an east or west wall it may go through instead of stopping.

Graphics:
    Add slam effects for the staff.
    Sweat animation when pulling on something you cannot move.
    Add Item Get Frame gfx/wukongimportantitem.png 20x28
    Add sparkles to peach loot + hud.
    Add damage effects for hitting enemies?
    Add damage effect for player hurt? (alttp doesn't have anything like this)

Current tasks:
    Fix missing ceiling edge tiles in waterfall tower
    Add crystal spike tiles once I get the final version from Jon
        - Replace pits near bead flows with spikes, the respawn logic on the bead flows can make
        you start about to fall into nearby pits.
        - Alternatively, just remove the respawn logic from the bead flows and add extra respawn
        points if necessary.

    Editor Improvements
        - Track which zones have been changed but not exported.
        - Support undo/redo actions
            - Include in context menu when editor is active
        - Add graphical palettes
            - (low priority) super tile layout selection

    Note: Make chest flash briefly in alternate world when it spawns in the alternate world.
    - So if you hit a switch that makes a chest in the alternate world you have a sense of what it did.

    - Spirit World Improvements
        - Sky is covered in cracked crystal ground that require cloud boots to walk on
            - Sky also drains spirit energy + cloud boots should require spirit energy to float
        - Need to figure out path to the sky mountains in spirit world that doesn't require completing waterfall tower.
            - Maybe the forge has an entrance in the main spirit world and an entrance in the mountains, similar to waterfall tower
            - Could have a gate from the spirit world sky mountains to the material world mountains for easier access to the crater. (Although mitts also give you easy access)
            - Probably simplest to just use the same connector cave from the material world, but it is easier to pass in the spirit world

    - Improvements
        - There should be a name indicator on the menu for the tool the cursor is over
            - Including the "help" icon
        - Passive tools should be selectable in the menu and show a tutorial on selection

        - Squirrel velocity should reset when knocked back
        - Add SFX when the MC is damaged

    - Add sleeping Vanara to the Cocoon.
        - Can use a special NPC that doesn't face you when talking for now.
        - Use a variety of colors.

    World Tree
        Tower is a series of 2x2 super tiles with a vine for climbing to the next section that
        Floor 1 is land level + underwater(in material world)
            - Fight frost beast and destroy heart before advancing.
        Floor 2 is sky level + has unlockable exit to sky (in material world only)
            - Fight storm beast and destroy heart before advancing.
        Floor 3 is atmosphere level + is hot
            - Fight flame beast and destroy heart before advancing.
        Floor 4 is lower orbit + material zones have low gravity
            - Fith all elemental beasts together without hearts
        Floor 5 has final boss
        - Giant tree grows just to the north of the war temple and into the sky, occupying unused spaces in the SE corner of the map.
        - Climb giant vines in the tree to reach the top
        - Lower level parts may have parts where you go out and branches so you can see how high up you are getting
        - Tree is a clone of the helix, but allowed to grow to completion this time.

    World Tree Boss Void Beast
        Must rescue Champion and work together to defeat the boss
            - Mechanics where one of you creates an opening for the other to damage the boss.
            - Mechanics where you protect each other from boss attacks.
            - Failure to protect champion will:
                - Require completing a rescue mechanic or waiting long enough for her to free herself
                - Cannot benefit from champion mechanics for damage or protection while champion is out of comission
        Phases where specific elements are required to damage it.
        Phases designed for each tool, but does not require them
            - Tools can give extra opportunities to damage the boss
                - Barrier to reflect projectiles/protect champion while they attack.
                    - Maybe a mechanic where you put up a barrier and reflect attacks while she prepares a strong attack against the boss
                - Bow to shoot distant weak spots
            - Tools can make it easier to avoid attacks

    Lab + World Tree Notes:
        - Requires all elements to complete
        - Fight rival near the start to claim the last element
        - Possible flow:
            Enter throne room of the War Temple in the Spirit World and fight rival, get last element and open tunnel entrance.
                - This step is only completable after fighting the rival during the 3rd spirit beast battle.
            Tunnel takes you to the lab where the War God's Scientists have been creating Hybrdid creatures and have made a modified World Tree Seed from the Helix.
            Can(must?) find clone upgrade to complete the lab.
            The seed is activated(possibly by combined proximity of champion+MC) and grows a giant tree that MC must climb to rescue the Champion and stop the War God.
            The War God will use the engine to make a breeding ground for his drone soldiers, the MC might use it to synthesize the Vanara and Native life to coexist.

    - Add Sky Paths for Staff Tower
        - Mountain or Forest path to reach river temple roof (lightning only route)
        - Mountain -> River Temple
            - Once we add landing points this will fix the bug with landing on top of the door
        - Forest Path to Sky Palace entrance (Add Sky palace stub with roll 2 + nimbus cloud)
            - Implement roll 2, just roll again while rolling, double speed / teleport then regular roll (with poof effects from staff)
            - Implement nimbus cloud using spawn points + script events choice mechanic for now
                - Allows returning to entrance inside areas
                - Allows teleporting to specific places visited on the overworld, possibly between material/spirit worlds.

    - Flying enemies should not move over abyss tiles(make abyss tiles + ceiling tiles impassable to flying enemies).

    - Support logic checks inside script events
        - Could just do `{logic:condition|trueAction|falseAction}`
        - Maybe better to add some recursive syntax to script events so we can embed logic in other event types
        - like {choice:REST?|Yes:{logic:isSpiritWorld|spiritRest|normalRest}|No}

    Peach Cave improvements
        - Add new graphics to 2F
        - Fix spirit world tiles
            - Add 4 easy checks to top floor and bombable pit entrance to basement
            - Require Mitts for entering from the bottom floor.
            - Add harder beetle boss with a Peach piece on it
            - Add 3 checks behind different tool combinations
                - cracked ground for cloud boots/ice magic
                - staff or teleportation to get across pits
                - bow+torches or fire element to unfreeze a chest

    - Add behavior that prevents non-flying enemies from crossing tiles/objects, use for cracked ground, escalators, bead cascades, etc.
        - Anything that doesn't handle enemies gracefully either needs to keep enemies out or add handling.


    - Consider adding `isActive(state, area)` method on enemy that returns true if the enemy can attack in the given area. Use in logic for removing discharge from area if enemy source is invalid.

    Storm Beast
        - Storm Beast can turn into lightning and teleport as a beam sending shockwaves out at both ends.
        - Storm Beast can charge south to exit the battle field

    - Game occasionally plays small bits of music while muted.

    Make mutation transition use the same area instance so contents don't reset
        - Will need to add special handling to remove extra ice tiles from frost beast+heat sink battles.

    - Randomizer improvements
        - Add configurable goal
        - Fix can get permanently stuck in areas:
            - Saving in Cocoon save point is a soft lock without teleportation.
        - Fix can get stuck and require refreshing the browser:
            - Falling in War Temple Big Key area without the Big Key
            - Falling in Peach Cave without a weapon and killing the small bug.
        - Support `entrances` instead of `entranceIds` on randomizer logic to include logic on entrances, for example, adding logic for whether entrances to sky areas is possible from the staff tower.
            - For now we can add a path from the ground to the sky based on logic: canAquireTowerStaff.

    - Add new hold+walk chakram animations
        - play last 2 frames of attack animation on release.

    - Work on new waterfall graphics
        - Email Jon about waterfall graphic updates.

Staff Improvements:
    - Charging staff 2 should show a preview of where it will hit and get wider in addition to longer
        - This should start at 4x1, 5x1 then 6x2->10x2, 11x3->15x3, 16x4->20x4
        - Preview will only show the max size that will fit in the current space
        - Ideally you could move around while charging and the preview will update appropriately
        - Would be nice to have this preview behavior when holding down the staff button for staff 1.
    - If the staff doesn't have enough area, maybe it should still swing and hit, but despawn or bounce off the terrain after landing.

Difficulty shrine:
    - Can apply changes to entire dungeon
    - The shrine cannot be entered until at least one coin is found.
    - Exists in its own dimension, can have multiple entrances to make shortcuts
    - Has Save Statue inside.
    - Dungeon bound Lucky Coin
        - Maybe split into Silver Coins for dungeon and Gold Coins for boss
    - Usually 1 coin can be found inside the shrine itself
    - 1 point per coin
    - points can be rearranged at no cost
    - 1 point to make mechanics easier (usually a few options)
    - Some points are already applied to make the game easier
        - These can be removed and distributed elsewhere.
    - Remove boss webs
    - Reduce boss health
    - Take 1/2 damage
    - 1/2 boss life
    - easier traps (disable conveyer belts, remove spikes)
    - easier puzzles (required chests are made distinct from optional chests, positions of required items are moved to more easily accessible locations)

Throwing an object into a pit should use the pit animation rather than breaking.

Respawn improvements:
    Only adjust respawn when in the same screen area as the spawn point.
    Or possibly only adjust respawn when using specific doors.
        Map dungeon entrances to respawn points?

Tutorial Improvements:
    - chest instructions are lost if you exit without obtaining the chakram.
    - no instructions for picking up objects before obtaining the glove
    Add advanced combat/tool tutorials
        - Maybe NPCs in home cave, or some kind of training/tutorial dojo?
        - Hitting enemies with chakram held in hand
        - Default Charged chakram attack
        - Enemy iframes prevent them from damaging you
        - Maybe different sections for different tools.
        - Reflecting projectiles

Add more screen shakes:
    - Lava draining transition
    - Probably for some impactful boss attacks.
    - Maybe when falling from a large height.
    - Scene where elemental beasts escape and attack the holy city
        - Maybe could be periodic large shake+explosion as if there is a large explosion nearby
        - Could have different combination of effects to signify attacks from each type of elemental beast
        - Could make sure these effects are also used when actually fighting the beasts for consistency

Improve Staff Tower Setup:
    - Maybe should create a staff tower object and use this instead of the current layer solution
    - Then we can detect if you are facing the object and not standing inside it to deploy the tower.
    - Would force the tower to look consistent and make it easy to update when we have better graphics
    - Can also detect zone overworld vs sky to create the upper+lower parts correctly.
    - Can render consistent ground graphics for when the tower is not present.
    - Animation should be throwing staff into the sky as it grows with its shadow, then falls to the ground when the shadow is as large as the foundation.

High level list of things left to do:
    New dungeons(need enemies, mechanics, bosses, entrances):
        Grand Temple

        Tomb Boss
        Rival fight before Helix
        Helix Boss
            - Instead of fighting this boss, you will see it, but then abort because of the beasts attacking the city
            - Then you will actually fight this boss at the end of the Grand Temple or Jade Palace or possibly as a mid boss on the Warship.
    Missing mechanics:
        Difficulty shrines for dungeons/bosses
        Hero helping during first elemental beast fight

Charge Chakram Attack:
    - Maybe change level 1 charge to spin around hero in a circle twice? Brief 0.5s invulnerability with attack animation.
    - Charge level 2 could have 2 chakrams spin at different radiuses and directions? 50 mana, lasts 4 seconds.
Chakram Improvements:
    - Add some damage or charge time bonus for timing your next attack within X frames of catching the Chakram?

At some point I should write tests to validate certain things like:
    - All zone+object targets are defined.
    - All bombable + locked doors have ids, all objects with saveStatus set have ids.
    - All objectFlags correspond to some object or dialogue key or loot type
    - All escaped dialogue corresponds to a special frame or loot type.

Additional Clone Tool Behavior:
    Charging the clone 1 level adds elements to the clones weapon/tools/explosion.
    Charging the clone 1 level without elements makes it invulnerable for 4 seconds.

Additional Bow Behavior:
    Arrows should have stuck frames for diagonals or stick out orthoganal to whatever they hit.
    Charge level 2 creates an elemental explosion
        - Neutral element can destroy objects similar to clone explosion.

Peach Cave Improvements:
    - Add enemies:
        - Eggs that hatch into enemies if not destroyed first
    - Sticky Web Ground
    - Add boss:
        - Spawns eggs
        - Drains light and regains a bit of health for every 25% lost

    - Update arrow turret graphics.

Golem Boss Improvements:
    - Tighten up timing when switching between attacks
        - Cut short any hand actions that aren't close to completion when starting enrage modes.
    - Slam both hands together
    - Quickly slam both hands in succession a single time.
    - Knocking bolders down from the ceiling (use rock riles + rock particles when they break)
        - Could drop some down for certian fist slam attacks
        - Could have the boss slam against the walls when strafing side to side or raise entire body and slam ground to drop stones.
        - Could also drop additional permanent barries that reduce the safe zones on the sides.

Dungeon 2 Improvements:
    - Add more uses of spirit sight:
        - See actual elemental beasts in the front room where the statues are located.
        - Some kind of optional spirit sight puzzle for a peach piece.

    - Add new enemies.
    - Make the guardian's projection use more interesting attacks.
    - Animate the ents when they attack.

Waterfall Tower Improvments:
    - Make bead flows act like shallow water for when you are walking in them?
        - This might not be the right animation for beads though.
    - Missing mechanics
        Rusty floor switch that only activates if you fall on it wearing iron boots.

River Temple Improvements:
    - Some underwater enemies
    - Some crab enemies with ice shells that require fire element to defeat
    - Maybe torches should stay lit during the boss fight once turned on.


Staff Tower Improvements
    - Add content to 4F Material world, probably some sort of gauntlet that is easier when the boss is defeated.
        - Should have a short cut so it can by bypassed after completing once.
    - All machine enemies have an offline state where they cannot be damaged, and possibly can be pushed around.
        - Hitting offline machines with lightning will turn them on.
        - Machines all default to offline except in the material world when the Storm Beast is active.
    - Conveyer belts/escalators.
        - Conveyer belts should also effect movable object/enemies on the ground touching them.
        - Ice magic can freeze the conveyer belts which stops them but makes them slippery.
        - Lightning magic will turn a conveyer belt on if it is off.
    - Disabled conveyer belt with pots on it that needs to be turned on to move the pots out of the way.


Crater Improvements
    - Add platforms floating on lava.
    - Add peg switches that require hitting with the staff to activate, replace all regular switches with these.
    - Add Flame Guardian enemies
        - Stationary like Crystal Guardian
        - Replace ents with Flame Guardians
    - Lava Fireballs that spawn from lava in an anulus around player about ever 4 seconds
        - Rise into the air then explode into 8 fireballs.
    - Add Shepard's Maw enemy
        - Like a carnivorous plant in the spirit world
        - Projects fake enemies on tendrils into the material world to herd prey to its mouth
            - Fake enemies attack with projectiles or hot gas
        - Bites into the material world when the prey is near
        - Kill by evading the maw attack and then hitting it while it is briefly in material world
            - Or fight it in the spirit world if you are there
    - Add heat sink enemies
        - Like ghosts in material world
        - Become solid+vulnerable when they try to pump heat from the material world
        - Can turn lava tiles solid briefly, or solid tiles to ice
        - Will try to chase and freeze the player if they get near
            - Will lose interest in the player while frozen
        - 1 or 2 second cool down on freezing anything
    - Add Engorge Heat Sink mini boss
        - Giant heat sink that is cooling one of the under lava caves you uncover
        - 4x as large and slow, but shrinks and speeds up as damaged
        - About 2x faster than normal heats sinks at minimum size
        - On defeat it possesses the player giving them the "Cooling Spirit" ability (Fire Blessing).
        - The cave becomes hot again after the boss is defeated but they player is now immune to the effect.

War Lab
    - Praying Mantis-like bug soldiers
        - Can emerge from tubes when security beams are triggered in certain rooms.
        - Defensive stance with crossed arms that blocks most attacks
        - Leap strike attack in any direction
        - Possible dodge + Leap strike instead of blocking attack (like electric squirrel dodge)
        - Spinning Scythe projectile attack

Multi-area Boss ideas:
    - Plant-like boss that is growing in several chambers that you have to move between to defeat.
    - Boss that escapes and must be chased to different chambers.

Add Small Loot to editor that creates LootDrop
    - locked to tile grid
    - if on destructable tile (cuttable, pickup), not rendered/updated until the tile is destroyed.
        - This should actually be done for any loot, this will make it easy to hide keys under objects.
        - We can support progress items under tiles, but probably shouldn't actually use this in practice in order to avoid players searching under every tile. On the other hand, if we clearly telegraph when this happens, maybe we can void this problem and encourage players to use smart ways to check for things (like spirit sight to search under many objects for a key).
    - keep a hash of picked up objects in dungeons so these only replenish on leaving the dungeon.
    - Add an editor option to clear the history of picked up small loots.


Add ability to charge carried objects
    Hold the passive button when picking up an object to charge
    Charge level is limited both by level of gloves/bracers and charge level.
    Should add selected element to thrown object
    Apply element changes to tiles while you hold them (bush might burn up into ash in your hands with fire element, or turn to ice)


Improve Tool Selection:
    - Color around the selection + HUD indicator should match the color of the controller button (blue + yellow for X-Box)
    - Display a letter attached to the selection based on the button/keyboard key.

Additional Staff Behavior:
    - The sides of the staff should function as a wall rather than open ground.
    Charging the staff does a very large spin attack that knocks enemies away.
        Lvl 2 charge is a screen wide attack the applies damage+element to all enemies.
    Top N pixels of character should be drawn on foreground as well so that it appears in front of staff when facing north.
        - Probably should disable staff when character is standing on any tiles marked with low ceiling just in case.

Update collision detection and wiggle logic:
    - Create an array that is the width of the character(relative to movement direction) + 16
    - Assuming entry 8 = [ax, ay] and length - 9 = [ax + width - 1, ay] (for moving up or down) check pairs of 0 and 3 pixels every 4 pixels, so for w = 16, check 8+11,12+15,16+19,20+23. If any are blocked, movement is blocked, remember the blocked pixel index.
    - If movement is blocked if blocked index <= length / 2 then scan right starting at blocked index + 1. If w open pixels are found, wiggle right. If a blocked pixel is found at index >= length - w, then abort, wiggling is not possible.
    - If blocked index > length / 2, repeat the above except scanning left to check for left wiggle.

Some puzzle ideas:
    - A puzzle where 4 switches need to be hit in 200ms, you can blow up the clone in the middle to activate all at once.
    - If we place a block on top of a switch that toggles on release, we can make a door that requires you to push the block off of the switch.

Animate hearts refilling

Add spirit element that replaces the default 'none' element when the upgrade is found. In vanilla this would require getting all other elements first.

Idea:
    Objects you can bounce off of when jumping
        - Just make them solid and knock the player back a bit if the player's y velocity is >= some value?

Include some random dungeon design in the base game:
    - Location of key under object might change (there should be some clue where it is or use spirit sight).
    - Something like peg cave, but only a single peg needs to be pressed to open it (spirit sight reveals which?).
    - Something like Eastern Palace Foyer except the correct door isn't always the center door.

Keep in mind significance of design elements for future racing/randomizer.

Support 64x64 super tiles for world map. Or maybe just 48x48. Probably add this after Spirit World mechanics to make sure they perform okay together.

Possible tool: Leather gloves protect you from thorn bushes.
Possible tool: Leather boots let you walk on thorny ground without taking damage.

Dungeon flavor philosophy:
    All Vanara structures are part of the Vanara ship and related to some functionality, such as the regeneration pods.
    All Native structures are built to native spirit gods who functioned as servants to the old native spirit beings and were created for specific purposes like resource harvesting, processing and crafting.
