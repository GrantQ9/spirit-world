Include some random dungeon design in the base game:
    - Location of key under object might change (there should be some clue where it is or use spirit sight).
    - Something like peg cave, but only a single peg needs to be pressed to open it (spirit sight reveals which?).
    - Something like Easter Palace Foyer except the correct door isn't always the center door.

Keep in mind significance of design elements for future racing/randomizer.
