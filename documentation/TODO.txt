Test at http://localhost:81/alttp/public/

Low Priority Bugs:
    - Enemies can walk on stairs cases and over bead flows
        - Add an invisible enemy wall object?
    - Astral Projection appears in front of waterfall graphics only when south of main body in waterfall tower.
    - Pushing on a solid object sitting on thorny ground shouldn't hurt you:
        -return tileBehaviors and objectBehaviors separately, only damage if tile is solid+damaging.
    - Doors don't appear open when moving into them from a different section
        I think this is because the door doesn't update until it is in the current areaInstance
    - nextAreaInstance is not rendered in Safari
    - frost grenade blast isn't centered.
    - Don't open enemy doors when bosses are still alive?
        - Tomb boss door can open when killing snakes in some cases.

High Priority Bugs:
    Sometimes can't enter peach cave when sliding on ice?


Graphics:
    Sweat animation when pulling on something you cannot move.
    Add Item Get Frame gfx/wukongimportantitem.png 20x28
    Add sparkles to peach loot + hud.
    Add damage effects for hitting enemies?
    Add damage effect for player hurt? (alttp doesn't have anything like this)


Current tasks:
    - Forest Temple
        - Add temporary boss with clone tool.
    - Crater Dungeon
        - Entrance should be blocked by cooled solid magma until elemental beasts are released.
    - Randomizer improvements
        - Add a goal
        - Add passage to the peak peach piece in logic.
            - Chest is only in logic if the player has ice magic, gloves 2 or defeated the fire beast, even though it is obtainable without any of these before the fire beast is released.
        - Add Helix to logic
        - Add river temple to logic
        - Add forest temple to logic
        - Add crater to logic
    - brainstorm some dungeon/boss ideas, maybe for Staff Tower

    - Add target landing locations when falling from sky (also apply to the forest temple pits).
    - Add new hold+walk chakram animations
        - play last 2 frames of attack animation on release.
    - Add elemental particles
        - Replace bow glow with neutral charge particles and elemental particles.
        - Remove charge glow from all other tools.

    - Add dialogue objects that can trigger on entering areas or other triggers.
    - Change message rendering system to use the priority queue system to support nested messages.
    - Add new waterfall graphics
    - Add touchHit behavior to tiles that can define full hit properties for tiles/objects on touch
        - Add 'barrierDamage' to hit properties that will control exact magic damage when hitting the spirit barrier.
        - Set barrierDamage lower for clearable traps like thorns to allow players to walk through and clear them using spirit barrier. Set even lower for floor traps that cannot be cleared since they will hit every frame.



High level list of things left to do:
    New dungeons(need enemies, mechanics, bosses, entrances):
        Grand Temple
        Jade Palace
        Sky Temple
        Forest Temple
        Forge
        Warship
    Areas missing significant content:
        River Temple
        Staff Tower
    Missing Bosses for existing areas:
        River Temple Boss
        Rival fight before Tomb
        Tomb Boss
        Rival fight before Helix
        Cocoon Boss
            - Instead of fighting this boss, you will see it, but then abort because of the beasts attacking the city
            - Then you will actually fight this boss at the end of the Grand Temple or Jade Palace or possibly as a mid boss on the Warship.
    Missing mechanics:
        Difficulty shrines
    Items missing implementation:
        Charge level 2
        Setting up Staff Tower
        Bow level 2
        Bow charge 2
        Clone charge 1 + 2
        True Sight (Render certain enemies/objects flagged for true sight)
        Iron Skin (slowly regenerates health shield = 20% total health)
        Gold Mail (reduce damage by 50%)
        Gloves charge 1 + 2

Generic boss improvements
    - Add vulnerable phases for bosses where they take ~5x damage, increase boss health by ~2x

Lava improvments:
    - Temporarily create solid ground when hit by ice.

Add toasts to development for undoing actions:
    - Deleting layers
    - Replacing > 100 tiles

Difficulty shrine:
    - 50 money per point
    - move points around for free
    - second chance = faerie
        - 100/200/300/400 for a filled chance, 50 for a refill
    - Or second chance is only for boss, and have a single refill tank that you can charge like in metroid?
    - Remove boss webs
    - Reduce boss health
    - Take 1/2 damage
    - 1/2 boss life
    - easier traps (disable conveyer belts, remove spikes)
    - easier puzzles (required chests are made distinct from optional chests, positions of required items are moved to more easily accessible locations)

Spirit Barrier Improvements
    - Charge adds element effect to barrier and reduces spirit loss to damage of that type
    - Make invisibility ignore certain ground effects+hazards: spikes, ice floor, fire barriers
    - Can move through activatable crystals and some other obstacles.
        * charge invisibility then dodge roll through a line of crystals to activate them quickly.

Charge Chakram Attack:
    - Maybe change level 1 charge to spin around hero in a circle twice? Brief 0.5s invulnerability with attack animation.
    - Charge level 2 could have 2 chakrams spin at different radiuses and directions? 50 mana, lasts 4 seconds.

At some point I should write tests to validate certain things like:
    - All zone+object targets are defined.
    - All bombable + locked doors have ids, all objects with saveStatus set have ids.
    - All objectFlags correspond to some object or dialogue key or loot type
    - All escaped dialogue corresponds to a special frame or loot type.

Additional Clone Tool Behavior:
    Charging the clone 1 level adds elements to the clones weapon/tools/explosion.
    Charging the clone 1 level without elements makes it invulnerable for 4 seconds.


Peach Cave Improvements:
    - Add enemies:
        - Eggs that hatch into enemies if not destroyed first
        - Vine enemies that can be knocked to the ground
    - Sticky Web Ground
    - Add boss:
        - Spawns eggs
        - Drains light and regains a bit of health for every 25% lost

Dungeon 1 Improvements:
    - Add rival fight when you open the door:
        - Rival guards the tomb
        - Rival is angered you have the Spirit Bow when you hit one of the switches.
        - If you are defeated, the elder may save you, otherwise it is game over.
    - Update wall laser graphics+behavior to actuall shoot lasers + be mounted on walls.
    - Update arrow turret graphics.

Dungeon 2 Improvements:
    - Add more uses of spirit sight:
        - See actual elemental beasts in the front room where the statues are located.
        - Some kind of optional spirit sight puzzle for a peach piece.

Dungeon 3 Improvements:
    - Add a required progress puzzle defeating enemies with rolling stones using spirit sight.
    - Make the guardian's projection use more interesting attacks.
    - Animate the ents when they attack.

Waterfall Tower Improvments:
    - Make bead flows act like shallow water for when you are walking in them?
        - This might not be the right animation for beads though.
    - Missing mechanics
        Make Crystal Spikes uncover the tiles they hit.
            - Add uncover effect to hits.
        Bead flows
            It would be nice to somehow treat the south edge of the flow as a wall when walking north, the current treatment is jittery with the knockback.
        Rusty floor switch that only activates if you fall on it wearing iron boots.
    - Boss: Crystal Collector
        - Add better spike attacks for main phase
        - Add better spike attacks for enrage
        - Passively summon spikes periodically whenever there are no floor eyes.
        - Passively enable bead cascades for 4 seconds every 5 seconds
            - Reduce to every 3 seconds for the final phase

River Temple Improvements:
    - Some underwater enemies
    - Some crab enemies with ice shells that require fire element to defeat


Crater Improvements
    - Add platforms floating on lava.
    - Add peg switches that require hitting with the staff to activate, replace all regular switches with these.
    - Add same area transition for lowering lava
        - Just draw the udpated area behind the old area, and then delete every 8th then 4th then 2nd then all rows of pixels.
        - Don't spend too much time on this since we might not use it in the end.
    - Add Flame Guardian enemies
        - Stationary like Crystal Guardian
        - Replace ents with Flame Guardians
    - Lava Fireballs that spawn from lava in an anulus around player about ever 4 seconds
        - Rise into the air then explode into 8 fireballs.
    - Add Shepard's Maw enemy
        - Like a carnivorous plant in the spirit world
        - Projects fake enemies on tendrils into the material world to herd prey to its mouth
            - Fake enemies attack with projectiles or hot gas
        - Bites into the material world when the prey is near
        - Kill by evading the maw attack and then hitting it while it is briefly in material world
            - Or fight it in the spirit world if you are there
    - Add heat sink enemies
        - Like ghosts in material world
        - Become solid+vulnerable when they try to pump heat from the material world
        - Can turn lava tiles solid briefly, or solid tiles to ice
        - Will try to chase and freeze the player if they get near
            - Will lose interest in the player while frozen
        - 1 or 2 second cool down on freezing anything
    - Add Engorge Heat Sink mini boss
        - Giant heat sink that is cooling one of the under lava caves you uncover
        - 4x as large and slow, but shrinks and speeds up as damaged
        - About 2x faster than normal heats sinks at minimum size
        - On defeat it possesses the player giving them the "Cooling Spirit" ability (Fire Blessing).
        - The cave becomes hot again after the boss is defeated but they player is now immune to the effect.


Multi-area Boss ideas:
    - Plant-like boss that is growing in several chambers that you have to move between to defeat.
    - Boss that escapes and must be chased to different chambers.

Add Small Loot to editor that creates LootDrop
    - locked to tile grid
    - if on destructable tile (cuttable, pickup), not rendered/updated until the tile is destroyed.
        - This should actually be done for any loot, this will make it easy to hide keys under objects.
        - We can support progress items under tiles, but probably shouldn't actually use this in practice in order to avoid players searching under every tile. On the other hand, if we clearly telegraph when this happens, maybe we can void this problem and encourage players to use smart ways to check for things (like spirit sight to search under many objects for a key).
    - keep a hash of picked up objects in dungeons so these only replenish on leaving the dungeon.
    - Add an editor option to clear the history of picked up small loots.


Add ability to charge carried objects
    Hold the passive button when picking up an object to charge
    Charge level is limited both by level of gloves/bracers and charge level.
    Should add selected element to thrown object
    Apply element changes to tiles while you hold them (bush might burn up into ash in your hands with fire element, or turn to ice)


Improve Tool Selection:
    - Color around the selection + HUD indicator should match the color of the controller button (blue + yellow for X-Box)
    - Display a letter attached to the selection based on the button/keyboard key.

Additional Staff Behavior:
    Should damage enemies + knock them away
    Eventually Lvl 2 staff can be used to create the Staff Tower.
    - The sides of the staff should function as a wall rather than open ground.
    Charging the staff does a very large spin attack that knocks enemies away.
        Lvl 2 charge is a screen wide attack the applies damage+element to all enemies.



Update collision detection and wiggle logic:
    - Create an array that is the width of the character(relative to movement direction) + 16
    - Assuming entry 8 = [ax, ay] and length - 9 = [ax + width - 1, ay] (for moving up or down) check pairs of 0 and 3 pixels every 4 pixels, so for w = 16, check 8+11,12+15,16+19,20+23. If any are blocked, movement is blocked, remember the blocked pixel index.
    - If movement is blocked if blocked index <= length / 2 then scan right starting at blocked index + 1. If w open pixels are found, wiggle right. If a blocked pixel is found at index >= length - w, then abort, wiggling is not possible.
    - If blocked index > length / 2, repeat the above except scanning left to check for left wiggle.

Some puzzle ideas:
    - A puzzle where 4 switches need to be hit in 200ms, you can blow up the clone in the middle to activate all at once.
    - If we place a block on top of a switch that toggles on release, we can make a door that requires you to push the block off of the switch.

Track the object an arrow is stuck in and move it with that target until it disappears
    - Use a different 'stuck' frame for the arrow missing the head.

Animate hearts refilling

Add spirit element that replaces the default 'none' element when the upgrade is found. In vanilla this would require getting all other elements first.

Idea:
    Objects you can bounce off of when jumping
        - Just make them solid and knock the player back a bit if the player's y velocity is >= some value?

Include some random dungeon design in the base game:
    - Location of key under object might change (there should be some clue where it is or use spirit sight).
    - Something like peg cave, but only a single peg needs to be pressed to open it (spirit sight reveals which?).
    - Something like Eastern Palace Foyer except the correct door isn't always the center door.

Keep in mind significance of design elements for future racing/randomizer.

Support 64x64 super tiles for world map. Or maybe just 48x48. Probably add this after Spirit World mechanics to make sure they perform okay together.

Possible tool: Leather gloves protect you from thorn bushes.
Possible tool: Leather boots let you walk on thorny ground without taking damage.

Dungeon flavor philosophy:
    All Vanara structures are part of the Vanara ship and related to some functionality, such as the regeneration pods.
    All Native structures are built to native spirit gods who functioned as servants to the old native spirit beings and were created for specific purposes like resource harvesting, processing and crafting.

    - Built around a suspended animation capsule
        - The Vanara population is too large so they rotate members in and out of suspended animation.
        - Suspension pods erase Vanara memories to prevent then from becoming restless.
        - Pods also regenerate Vanara bodies, which would break down without nurishment from the spirit world.
